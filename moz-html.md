<strong>
  Why does Refined Prime Video need permission X?
</strong>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Access your data for sites in the primevideo.com domain</strong>
    This permission is required so that the extension can modify Prime Video’s behavior and appearance.
    &#32;
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Access your data for sites in the amazon.com / amazon.co.uk / amazon.de domain</strong>
    This permission might seem suspicious to users of primevideo.com but don’t worry: It’s required because there are some regions where Prime Video is part of the Amazon website (like amazon.de/video). Refined Prime Video will <em>never</em> abuse this permission to tamper with your Amazon account.
    &#32;
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Access browser tabs</strong>
    This permission is required so that when you click on a series in the extension popup, a new tab can be opened. Refined Prime Video will <em>never</em> abuse this permission to spy on the websites you visit.
  </li>
</ul>
